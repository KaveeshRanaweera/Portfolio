# Website Project

This is a responsive website built using HTML and CSS. It includes a home page with sections such as Header, About, Services, Portfolio, and Contact, designed to offer a smooth user experience across various screen sizes. This project is based on a tutorial from a YouTube video, which I have modified and upgraded by adding more features and options.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to look great on both desktop and mobile devices using media queries.
- **Smooth Animations**: Various hover effects and transitions add interactivity to the website elements.
- **Custom Styling**: The website includes custom fonts, a modern color palette, and a visually appealing layout.
- **Navigation Menu**: The navigation menu features a sliding effect for smaller screens, providing a smooth user experience on mobile devices.
- **Content Sections**:
  - **Header**: Full-page header with a background image and an introductory message.
  - **About**: Provides details about the website/project.
  - **Services**: Displays a list of services offered.
  - **Portfolio**: Showcases a portfolio section with image hover effects.
  - **Contact**: A form for users to contact you, along with social media links......
